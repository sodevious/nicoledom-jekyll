In working with The Shorty Awards, I had the pleasure of building both the front-end and backend of this new Django web application in 2015. I collaborated with designers and project managers on their requirements. I also built a <a href="https://rtacademy.org/styleguide/" target="_blank">styleguide</a> for the project, for other developers to be able to contribute and make modifications with ease.
