We like to have fun with the Shorty Awards, so each year we
create videos that run throughout the night. This year we decided
to up our illustration skills and create our own animations. I helped
illustrate some of the scenery in the ["Adventures of the Shorty Whale"](http://vimeo.com/91460240) video.

The "Flappy Whale" video was produced and animated entirely by myself
in Photoshop (suprisingly).
