About nine months ago, I attended my first hackathon and it was amazing. I met awesome designers and developers, and got to be [part of a little movement to use tech for good](http://hacknjill.com/blog/hacksgiving-rules-and-judging-criteria/) in the wake of hurricane Sandy. Sponsor prizes seemed to actually mean something, and it [wasn’t a competition](http://sodevious.me/post/51986098138/hackathons-should-not-be-about-business). I wish that hackathons still had the same kind of spirit.

Today, a friend of mine sent me an email [about attending an upcoming hackathon](https://www.elance.com/j/mobile-centric-hackathon/42670434/). It sounded great until I read this: 

>brief24 offers a fresh approach to creative problem-solving… five Top 100 Fortune participating companies will submit a brief by noon on June 27, 2013, and 24 hours later they will receive a working prototype

From those lines on, I continued to read just to laugh and be *appalled* that someone was calling this a ‘hackathon’. Any self respecting designer or developer should spot this as cheap, crowdsourced spec work. It’s a damn shame that anyone would consider even going to this, yet alone **plan** it.

To dig in the knife a little deeper, the *‘job posting’* was up on Elance - which I had to make an account just to access.

>Compensation: 

> * Designers will be compensated **up to $800** depending on experience 
* Developers will be compensated **$1000** depending on experience 
* Includes all meals (lunch, dinner, snacks, breakfast) during this period 
* All developers and designers **will need to be qualified** through a short preliminary screening process (details to follow). 


So, not only are they compensating designers and developers a ridiculous amount of money that they may or may not earn, they have to be vetted! I think this is a joke, honestly. That equates to **$33/hour for designers** at the most, and **$40/hour for developers** in NYC. These rates are pitifully sad, especially for NYC, where a serious designer or developer should charge you at least double that. Remember, this is top notch work done within a 24 period for **Top 100 Fortune companies** at rates that don’t even compete with industry standard in NYC. 

A quick google search [suggests that](https://grouptalent.com/blog/how-much-developers-make-per-city) developers on average charge $90/hour in New York. Let’s do the math here…

* 8 Hours in a work day: $720
* 16 overtime hours at time and a half: $2160


That’s **$2880** that these developers should be making on average, whereas they are being offered more than half of that at **$1000** for 24 straight hours worth of work.

This is just what my mother warned me about when I started hacking. It’s so sad that this is true.
