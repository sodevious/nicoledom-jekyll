We live in a culture that portrays “work” as the enemy. We all try to or dream about "quitting our jobs" or creating the "4 hour work week". Ya’ll dread waking up Monday morning, or would do anything to head to the bar at 4:30PM on a Friday - because, hey it’s five o’clock somewhere, right?

But maybe we should be focusing on creating the kind of career path that makes you want to come in early and leave late. It stops becoming work and starts becoming a part of you. A part of your life that is fulfilling and gives you the what you put into it.

Enjoyable, fun and challenging work is the key to a fulfilling life. I think so at least. The data (a Google search) says we spend about 30% of our lives at work. So how can one truly be happy while spending a third of their lives miserable, patiently staring at the clock waiting for it to be over?

Please don't settle in a job or career only to be stuck there. Take the time to find or create your dream job. It will make you happy. It will give you purpose. It's the beginning of your career, so make it count. 

I cannot express in words how grateful I am to have a successful career and to be **absolutely in love** with my "job". And the only way I got here was because I challenged social norms and chased my dreams. Now I'm living in a fairytale that I never thought possible five years ago.
