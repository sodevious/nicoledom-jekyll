Don’t think that you have to try to get VC / Angel funding just because you’re trying to get a startup off the ground. The point of a startup is that it’s a business right? So why not build a business that makes it’s own money rather than borrowing someone else’s?

**Build your product first!** Maybe your business model isn’t so tight as you thought - or maybe the market isn’t there.

…if you’re going to hire or contract out to someone to build your MVP, make sure that person will be more than just a robot. If you are non-technical, find someone you trust to help guide development and that will have their own ideas to move the prototype along.
