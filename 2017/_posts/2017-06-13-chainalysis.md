### Redesigning Homepage

I was approached by Chainalysis to redesign and build a last minute single-page website, for a demo the following week. In collaborating with the team and gathering requirements, I was able to successfully define a visual style for the marketing website, as well as design and develop that single-page website. I also designed illustrations that went along with the marketing site.

I built the site in Jekyll, using Github pages as a sandbox. It uses Foundation and Sass. I also implemented the Contentful API using Javascript and Handlebars to render dynamic press quotes that could be edited by anyone on the team, without having to deploy or write code.

### Chainalysis Blog

Needing a bit more than a static landing page, my client asked for a blog to accompany their current site. We put together a <a href="https://ghost.org/developers/" target="_blank">Ghost</a> blog, and I designed and built a theme for them.
