### Redesigning Website

The client needed an update to their previous website, which was a messy Wordpress theme. It wasn't really serving their needs well, nor did it help their patients and clients get all of the necessary information they needed. I worked with the client to prioritize content, and present it in a way that made sense to the end users and was easily digestible. Branding by [pix-l graphx](http://pixlgraphx.com).
